## ðŸ§  What's My Purpose?

This single-page angular web application was created to centralize the information I wanted to a single webpage. It communicates with [Home Page Api](https://github.com/rbrock44/home-page-api) for Basketball, Football, MMA and Auction data. It was expanded to hold the concerts attended and matches (think sports games, like Cardinals vs Cubs (baseball)). Overall it's a very handy tool used daily in my life
